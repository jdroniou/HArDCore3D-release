Brief description of the RF format:

** Each mesh is described by a .ele and a .node file. All lines starting with # are comments

** .node file: describes the vertices of the mesh

  - first line: header specifying the following:
       <number of vertices> <dimension> <flag1> <flag2>
    (with dimension=3, flag1=flag2=0)
  - following lines: one line per vertex with this syntax:
        <vertex id> <x coordinate> <y coordinate> <z coordinate>
    (verted ids should start at 0)
    
** .ele file: describes the cells (elements), through their faces

  - first line: header with the following syntax:
      <number of cells> <flag1>
    (with flag1=0)
  - then, for each cell:
      (i) a line with the the cell header; syntax:
          <cell id> <number of faces>
      (ii) a line for each face with the list of the vertices of the face:
          <face id, local to the cell> <number of vertices> <id of first vertex> <id of second vertex> ...
      (ids should be consistent with vertex ids and start at 0)
