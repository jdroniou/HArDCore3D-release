H\+Ar\+D\+::\+Core (sources\+: \href{https://github.com/jdroniou/HArDCore}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/jdroniou/\+H\+Ar\+D\+Core}}) provides a suite of C++ tools to implement numerical schemes whose unknowns are polynomials in the cells, on the edges, and on the faces. The focus is on dealing on generic polytopal meshes. This documentation addresses the 3D version of H\+Ar\+D\+::\+Core, but similar principles are valid for the 2D version. Transferring a scheme\textquotesingle{}s implementation from 3D to 2D or vice-\/versa is very straightforward, provided that the scheme\textquotesingle{}s mathematical definition does not depend on the dimension and that the generic types provided in {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{basis_8hpp}{basis.\+hpp}}} and {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{MeshObject_8hpp}{Mesh\+Object.\+hpp}}} are used; see readme file of the H\+Ar\+D\+::\+Core github depository \href{https://github.com/jdroniou/HArDCore}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/jdroniou/\+H\+Ar\+D\+Core}}.

 \hypertarget{index_build}{}\doxysection{Build instructions}\label{index_build}
\hypertarget{index_buildlib}{}\doxysubsection{Building the libraries and the schemes}\label{index_buildlib}
To build the libraries and implemented schemes, the minimal requirements are\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item C\+Make version 2.\+6 or above (\href{https://cmake.org/}{\texttt{ https\+://cmake.\+org/}})
\item A C++ compiler that supports the C++14 standard, eg. G\+CC (\href{https://gcc.gnu.org/}{\texttt{ https\+://gcc.\+gnu.\+org/}}) or Clang (\href{https://clang.llvm.org/}{\texttt{ https\+://clang.\+llvm.\+org/}})
\item Eigen C++ library, version 3.\+3 or above (\href{http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/}{\texttt{ http\+://eigen.\+tuxfamily.\+org/}})
\item The following Boost C++ libraries (\href{http://www.boost.org/}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+boost.\+org/}})\+: filesystem, program options, timer, chrono.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Make sure that you have the development version of boost installed. On Linux, install {\ttfamily libboost-\/dev}, {\ttfamily libboost-\/filesystem-\/dev}, {\ttfamily libboost-\/program-\/options-\/dev}, {\ttfamily libboost-\/chrono-\/dev} and {\ttfamily libboost-\/timer-\/dev} from your package manager.

The linear systems resulting from the assembled scheme are solved using the Bi\+C\+G\+Stab implementation of Eigen. Alternatives are also provided, but require additional libraries (U\+M\+F\+P\+A\+CK, S\+U\+P\+E\+R\+LU, etc.); see the main C\+Make\+Lists.\+txt file.

Once you have installed all of the required dependencies, set up the build directory and generate the build files by running the following from the repository root\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{mkdir build}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd build}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake ..}
\DoxyCodeLine{make}
\end{DoxyCode}


After this, {\ttfamily build/\+Schemes} will contain the executables (e.\+g. {\ttfamily hho-\/diffusion}) to run the schemes. These executables need to access the meshes, which they should naturally find if you have left the {\ttfamily meshes} directory at the root of the project\textquotesingle{}s files.\hypertarget{index_doco}{}\doxysubsection{Building the Documentation}\label{index_doco}
The mesh documentation is built with Doxygen (\href{http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+stack.\+nl/$\sim$dimitri/doxygen/}}). If you are reading this then somebody has already built it for you. If you modify the code and wish to rebuild the documentation, simply run {\ttfamily doxygen} from the root directory. The H\+T\+ML version of the documentation is generated inside {\ttfamily docs} and the La\+TeX version is generated inside {\ttfamily docs/latex} and can be compiled using the generated Makefile.

\label{_mesh}%
 \hypertarget{index_mesh}{}\doxysection{Mesh module}\label{index_mesh}
\hypertarget{index_meshpple}{}\doxysubsection{Principles}\label{index_meshpple}
After it is loaded, the mesh is represented by typedefs of \mbox{\hyperlink{classMeshND_1_1MeshObject}{Mesh\+Object}} describing a Vertex, an Edge, a Face, and a Cell. Each of these classes contains methods to access useful information for the corresponding element, including other geometrical quantities it is related to. The mesh itself is represented by an element of the \mbox{\hyperlink{classMeshND_1_1Mesh}{Mesh}} class with methods to access all the vertices, edges, faces and cells (or a particular vertex, edge, face or cell).

For example, if {\ttfamily mesh\+\_\+ptr} is a pointer to a \mbox{\hyperlink{classMeshND_1_1Mesh}{Mesh}} instance, the lines 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\mbox{\hyperlink{namespaceMesh2D_aff8af6d9e4621304984811aba3c8691f}{Vertex}}* vertex = mesh\_ptr-\/>vertex(5);}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{Eigen::Vector3d vert\_coord = vertex-\/>coords()}
\end{DoxyCode}
 store the coordinates of the fifth vertex into the Eigen vector {\ttfamily vert\+\_\+coord}. As a generic rule, all geometrical vectors are {\ttfamily Eigen\+::\+Vector3d}. We also use {\ttfamily Eigen\+::\+Vector\{3,X\}d} and {\ttfamily Eigen\+::\+Matrix\{3,X\}d} for objects on which linear algebraic operations are performed. Lists (e.\+g. of cells, of functions...) are usually instances of {\ttfamily std\+::vector$<$...$>$}. Finally, {\ttfamily Eigen\+::multi\+\_\+array} is used for lists of values of functions at quadrature nodes.

Here is an example that loops over all cells, grabs all the faces of the cell, and loops over these faces to output their diameter. Here, {\ttfamily mesh\+\_\+ptr} is a pointer to the mesh.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// Loop over all cells of the mesh}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keywordflow}{for} (\textcolor{keywordtype}{size\_t} iT = 0; iT < mesh\_ptr-\/>n\_cells() iT++) \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    \textcolor{comment}{// We grab the faces of the iT-\/th cell}}
\DoxyCodeLine{    std::vector<Face *> faces = mesh\_ptr-\/>cell(iT)-\/>get\_faces();}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    \textcolor{comment}{// Loop over the faces of the cell}}
\DoxyCodeLine{    \textcolor{keywordflow}{for} (\textcolor{keywordtype}{size\_t} ilF = 0; ilF < cell-\/>n\_faces(); ilF++) \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{        \textcolor{comment}{// Write the face diameter on the standard output}}
\DoxyCodeLine{        std::cout << \textcolor{stringliteral}{"The diameter of face "} << ilF+1 << \textcolor{stringliteral}{" in cell "} << iT+1 << \textcolor{stringliteral}{" is: "} << faces(ilF)-\/>diam() << \textcolor{stringliteral}{"\(\backslash\)n"};}
\DoxyCodeLine{    \}}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}
\end{DoxyCode}


There is no direct access from a high-\/level geometrical entity to elements purely associated with lower-\/level entities. For example, if {\ttfamily mesh\+\_\+ptr} is a pointer to the mesh, there is no direct method to access the coordinates of the i-\/th vertex of the mesh (no {\ttfamily mesh\+\_\+ptr-\/$>$coords\+\_\+vertex()} exists). Instead, this is done through {\ttfamily mesh\+\_\+ptr-\/$>$vertex(i)-\/$>$coords()}. This choice is deliberate as it preserves the logical organisation of the data structure, and facilitates the memorisation of the various methods. Of course, writing a wrapper providing such a direct access is easy...\hypertarget{index_loading_mesh}{}\doxysubsection{Loading a mesh}\label{index_loading_mesh}
\mbox{\hyperlink{namespaceHArDCore3D}{H\+Ar\+D\+Core3D}} can read meshes in {\ttfamily RF} format. Previous versions could read {\ttfamily TG} and {\ttfamily M\+SH} files and were based on G. Manzini\textquotesingle{}s mesh library \href{https://github.com/gmanzini-LANL/PDE-Mesh-Manager}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/gmanzini-\/\+L\+A\+N\+L/\+P\+D\+E-\/\+Mesh-\/\+Manager}}. From Version 4.\+1, \mbox{\hyperlink{namespaceHArDCore3D}{H\+Ar\+D\+Core3D}} uses an independent mesh reader written by L. Yemm.

A mesh file must be read using an instance of the {\ttfamily meshbuilder} class, and then built using {\ttfamily build\+\_\+the\+\_\+mesh}. A working example is given below (assuming the executable will be in {\ttfamily build/\+Schemes} for example).


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{preprocessor}{\#include "\mbox{\hyperlink{mesh_8hpp}{mesh.hpp}}"}}

\DoxyCodeLine{  std::string mesh\_file = \textcolor{stringliteral}{"../../meshes/Voro-\/small-\/0/RF\_fmt/voro-\/4"};}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  \textcolor{comment}{// Build the mesh}}
\DoxyCodeLine{  \mbox{\hyperlink{classHArDCore3D_1_1MeshBuilder}{MeshBuilder}} meshbuilder = \mbox{\hyperlink{classHArDCore3D_1_1MeshBuilder}{MeshBuilder}}(mesh\_file);}
\DoxyCodeLine{  std::unique\_ptr<Mesh> mesh\_ptr = meshbuilder.\mbox{\hyperlink{classHArDCore3D_1_1MeshBuilder_a208c94e8cb6490226215b59eb67e7911}{build\_the\_mesh}}();}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  std::cout << \textcolor{stringliteral}{"There are "} << mesh\_ptr-\/>n\_cells() << \textcolor{stringliteral}{" cells in the mesh.\(\backslash\)n"};}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}
\end{DoxyCode}


Note that the builder returns a {\ttfamily unique\+\_\+ptr} for the mesh. This ensures that, at the end of the execution, the mesh destructor is called (which destroys all cells, faces, edges, vertices...). Some classes and functions use a raw pointer to the mesh, so the {\ttfamily .get()} method should be used when passing the mesh as argument to the class constructors or functions.

{\itshape Note}\+: the mesh formats allow for meshes with very generic polygonal cells, including non-\/convex cells. However, the builder assumes that each cell is star-\/shaped with respect to the isobarycenter of its vertices -- otherwise, the calculation of the center of mass may be incorrect. Similarly, the quadrature rules (see \href{\#quad_rules}{\texttt{ Quadrature rules}}) assume that each cell is star-\/shaped with respect to its center of mass.

\label{_common}%
 \hypertarget{index_common_module}{}\doxysection{Common module}\label{index_common_module}
The main classes in the \mbox{\hyperlink{group__Common}{Common}} describe polynomial basis functions on a cell, face, or edge. These could be bases of full polynomial spaces $\mathbb{P}^k$, or other related spaces (vector-\/valued polynomials, subspaces, image of gradient, image of curl, complements, etc.). The underlying basis functions are monomial (\mbox{\hyperlink{classHArDCore3D_1_1MonomialScalarBasisCell}{Monomial\+Scalar\+Basis\+Cell}} and \mbox{\hyperlink{classHArDCore3D_1_1MonomialScalarBasisFace}{Monomial\+Scalar\+Basis\+Face}}), but derived bases (or set of non-\/necessarily linearly independent polynomial functions) can be handled through various classes, such as \mbox{\hyperlink{classHArDCore3D_1_1Family}{Family}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{classHArDCore3D_1_1TensorizedVectorFamily}{Tensorized\+Vector\+Family}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{classHArDCore3D_1_1GradientBasis}{Gradient\+Basis}}, etc.

Free functions are also available to compute basis functions at quadrature nodes (using the \href{\#quad_rules}{\texttt{ Quadrature rules}} module), orthonormalise basis functions, and compute Gram-\/like matrices between various families of functions. These matrices are essential in the design of high-\/order methods on polytopal meshes. Again, see examples in the \href{\#hybridcore}{\texttt{ Hybrid\+Core}}, \href{\#ddr}{\texttt{ D\+D\+R\+Core}} and the various schemes built on them.

This module also contains\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{structHArDCore3D_1_1PolynomialSpaceDimension}{Polynomial\+Space\+Dimension}}\+: structure to compute the dimensions of various polynomial spaces on edges, faces and cell,
\item D\+O\+F\+Space\+: class to access the local degrees of freedom associated with a geometric entity (vertex, edge, face, or cell) and all its associated entities of smaller dimension. This class determines how the local degrees of freedom are ordered (in the current setting, it\textquotesingle{}s by increasing dimension of the associated geometric entities\+: D\+O\+Fs of vertices, D\+O\+Fs of edges, D\+O\+Fs of faces and finally D\+O\+Fs of cells).
\end{DoxyItemize}

\label{_quad_rules}%
 \hypertarget{index_quad_rules}{}\doxysection{Integration over mesh geometric entities}\label{index_quad_rules}
\hypertarget{index_usage_quad}{}\doxysubsection{Generic quadrature rules.}\label{index_usage_quad}
H\+Ar\+D\+::\+Core deals with quite arbitrary cell geometries. As a consequence, no reference element can be used, and the quadrature rules have to be adjusted to each particular cell/face/edge. For the cells, for example, this is done by partitioning each cell into tetrahedra and by using classical quadrature rules on tetrahedras. The choice was also made not to pre-\/compute all quadrature rules for all cells, faces and edges, but rather to compute them -- with a locally chosen degree of exactness -- when needed in the code. To reduce the computational cost, quadrature rules -- and the values of basis functions at quadrature nodes -- should only be computed once when looping over each cell, before being used, e.\+g., to form mass matrices.

The \mbox{\hyperlink{group__Quadratures}{Quadratures}} module provides routines to do that. The key method, \mbox{\hyperlink{group__Quadratures_ga18d0a2cf574bef7d6e83760de2f38152}{generate\+\_\+quadrature\+\_\+rule(C\+FE,doe)}}, calculates quadrature nodes and weights, exact up to the polynomial degree {\ttfamily doe}, for an integration over cell/face/edge C\+FE (passed as a reference of Cell, Face or Edge class). At present, the quadrature rules available in the code support a total degree of exactness in the cells up to 14 in the cells and 20 on the faces and the edges (the quadrature rules on the faces come from \href{https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/cpp_src/triangle_dunavant_rule/triangle_dunavant_rule.html}{\texttt{ John Burkardt\textquotesingle{}s implementation of the Dunavant rules}}). The generated quadrature rule is stored in a structure \mbox{\hyperlink{group__Quadratures_ga41055a24d71d12c64b5fddddc0bbad22}{Quadrature\+Rule}}, which is a vector of quadrature nodes (weights and position).

The \mbox{\hyperlink{structHArDCore3D_1_1evaluate__quad}{evaluate\+\_\+quad}} template function evaluate basis functions (their value, gradients, etc.) at provided quadrature nodes. The {\ttfamily boost\+::multi\+\_\+array} provided by this function can then be passed to \mbox{\hyperlink{group__Basis_gaf5cc3ed71949b5d7adc5877e6bfebcb4}{compute\+\_\+gram\+\_\+matrix}} to create a matrix of inner products of two families of basis functions. Here is an example.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// Create basis (f\_1,...,f\_r) of degree k in cell T}}
\DoxyCodeLine{MonomialScalarBasisCell basisT(T, k);}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// Create quadrature rules of degree 2*k in cell T}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\mbox{\hyperlink{group__Quadratures_ga41055a24d71d12c64b5fddddc0bbad22}{QuadratureRule}} quadT = \mbox{\hyperlink{group__Quadratures_ga18d0a2cf574bef7d6e83760de2f38152}{generate\_quadrature\_rule}}(T, 2*k);}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// Compute values of gradients of basis functions at the quadrature nodes}}
\DoxyCodeLine{boost::multi\_array<VectorRd, 2> gradbasis\_on\_quadT = evaluate\_quad<Gradient>::compute(basisT, quadT);}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// Create Gram-\/like matrix (here, a stiffness matix) of (\(\backslash\)nabla f\_i,\(\backslash\)nabla f\_j)\_ij}}
\DoxyCodeLine{Eigen::MatrixXd M = \mbox{\hyperlink{group__Basis_gaf5cc3ed71949b5d7adc5877e6bfebcb4}{compute\_gram\_matrix}}(gradbasis\_on\_quadT, quadT);}
\end{DoxyCode}


Note the usage of the type {\ttfamily Vector\+Rd} defined in {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{basis_8hpp}{basis.\+hpp}}}, which enables for a dimension-\/independent piece of code (easier to adapt to the 2D case). This procedure can also be applied, e.\+g., to cell basis functions on face quadrature nodes, etc. Additionally, the values at quadrature nodes obtained via \mbox{\hyperlink{structHArDCore3D_1_1evaluate__quad}{evaluate\+\_\+quad}} can be transformed using \mbox{\hyperlink{group__Basis_ga95949745fd93384a9364fe5df73034ca}{transform\+\_\+values\+\_\+quad}} (see also \mbox{\hyperlink{group__Basis_ga46a7162dd1acacd29421a7d8db89c96e}{scalar\+\_\+product}} and \mbox{\hyperlink{group__Basis_ga7fd6906b30cba10f2f452b029a86ca00}{vector\+\_\+product}}); this gives for example an easy way of constructing the values at quadrature nodes on a face of normal or tangential traces of cell polynomials.

\label{_quad_rules}%
 \hypertarget{index_monomial_integration}{}\doxysection{Homogeneous Numerical Integration (\+H\+N\+I) of polynomials, and Gram matrices}\label{index_monomial_integration}
Because of the generality of some polytopal elements and the resulting need to generate quadrature rules by splitting the elements into tetrahedra, quadrature rules can very quickly reach a very large number of nodes (more than 1000 on some Voronoi cells for higher degrees of exactness). The calculation of integrals, and in particular of Gram matrices, then represent a very large amount of the computational time. To remediate this, we have implemented in \mbox{\hyperlink{namespaceHArDCore3D}{H\+Ar\+D\+Core3D}} the H\+NI approach for monomials of \href{https://doi.org/10.1007/s00466-015-1213-7}{\texttt{ https\+://doi.\+org/10.\+1007/s00466-\/015-\/1213-\/7}}. Since all the polynomial bases in the \href{\#common}{\texttt{ Common}} module are built from monomial polynomials, this technique actually enables us to very efficiently compute Gram matrices of many of these bases.

The function \mbox{\hyperlink{group__Quadratures_ga017ba781ad8f6bb51d82473d6ea16dc9}{Gram\+Matrix}} precisely takes care of computing gram matrices of bases and derived sets of cell-\/ and face-\/polynomials. At the moment, it properly manages all the following cases.

\label{_hybridcore}%
 \hypertarget{index_hybridcore}{}\doxysection{Hybridcore module}\label{index_hybridcore}
This module encapsulates routines to create bases of polynomial spaces in each cell, on each face, and on each edge, and to manipulate discrete functions through the class \mbox{\hyperlink{classHArDCore3D_1_1UVector}{U\+Vector}}.\hypertarget{index_basisfunc}{}\doxysubsection{Basis functions}\label{index_basisfunc}
The instantiation of an \mbox{\hyperlink{group__HybridCore}{Hybrid\+Core}} class creates basis functions for the full polynomial spaces $\mathbb{P}^k$ in the cells, on the faces and on the edges, specifying the maximum degree required for each geometric entity. The basis functions are elements of the \mbox{\hyperlink{classHArDCore3D_1_1Family}{Family}} class and are accessed via the Cell\+Basis, Face\+Basis and Edge\+Basis method. For example, the following piece of code initialises an Hybrid\+Core instance with degrees $K+1$ in the cells, $K$ on the faces, and no edge basis functions, and access the value at some Eigen\+::\+Vector3d x of the i-\/th basis function on face iF, and the gradient of the j-\/th basis function in cell iT.

The basis functions are hierarchical, which means that they are constructed by increasing degree. Hence, for example, if cell basis functions up to degree $K+1$ have been generated, a basis of the space of polynomials of degree $K$ in the cell is thus obtained by selecting the first \mbox{\hyperlink{structHArDCore3D_1_1PolynomialSpaceDimension}{Polynomial\+Space\+Dimension$<$Cell$>$\+::Poly(K)}} cell basis functions.

The \mbox{\hyperlink{classHArDCore3D_1_1UVector}{U\+Vector}} class describes coefficients on cell and face basis functions. The first coefficients correspond to cell basis functions, ordered by the cells themselves, and the last coefficients correspond to face basis functions. The methods in this class provide the surrounding structure to make sense of these coefficients (degrees of considered polynomial functions in cells/on faces, restrictions to a certain cell and its faces, etc.).\hypertarget{index_qr_hcore}{}\doxysubsection{Quadrature rules evaluations in Hybrid\+Core}\label{index_qr_hcore}
As explained above, the \mbox{\hyperlink{structHArDCore3D_1_1evaluate__quad}{evaluate\+\_\+quad}} template enables the evaluation of basis functions (or their gradient, curl, or divergence) at pre-\/computed quadrature nodes. In the Hybrid\+Core module, however, the quadrature rules and values of basis functions (and gradients) at the quadrature nodes can be conveniently computed and stored using the \mbox{\hyperlink{classHArDCore3D_1_1ElementQuad}{Element\+Quad}} class. Instantiating an element of this class on a cell loads these rules and values once, that can then be passed to several functions in charge of various calculations (e.\+g. one function computes the local cell contribution to the diffusion term, another function is in charge of computing the load term associated to the cell, etc.). This prevents recomputing these rules and values when needed by various functions. It works the following way\+:

The \mbox{\hyperlink{group__HHO3D}{H\+H\+O3D}} module provides typedefs, a class and functions to implement Hybrid High Order (H\+HO) schemes. Rules (functions) to create local bilinear forms (matrices) and loading terms (vectors) are passed to the \mbox{\hyperlink{classHHO3D}{H\+H\+O3D}} class, that takes care of the global assembly and solving of the system.

\label{_ddr}%
 \hypertarget{index_ddr}{}\doxysection{D\+D\+R\+Core module}\label{index_ddr}
The \mbox{\hyperlink{group__DDRCore}{D\+D\+R\+Core}} module provides classes and functions to implement the discrete de Rham (D\+DR) complex. This complex is based on spaces with unknowns on all geometric entities (vertices, edges, faces and cells), and discrete differential operators acting between these spaces. It is based on the principles detailed in \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04940}{\texttt{ https\+://arxiv.\+org/abs/2101.\+04940}} (see also the founding work \href{https://doi.org/10.1142/S0218202520500372}{\texttt{ https\+://doi.\+org/10.\+1142/\+S0218202520500372}}).

It is built on the concepts in the \mbox{\hyperlink{group__Common}{Common}} module, in particular all the polynomial bases managed in the classes available in this module, as well as the local ordering of degrees of freedom defined by the D\+O\+F\+Space class. The main elements of the D\+D\+R\+Core module are\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item D\+D\+R\+Space\+: class to manipulate global degrees of freedom. As \href{\#ref HArDCore3D::DOFSpace}{\texttt{ D\+O\+F\+Space}} over which it\textquotesingle{}s built, this class organises the D\+O\+Fs by increasing order of the mesh entities dimensions (D\+O\+Fs linked to all vertices, then D\+O\+Fs linked to all edges, then D\+O\+Fs linked to all faces, and finally all D\+O\+Fs linked to cells). These D\+O\+Fs only make sense when bases of polynomial spaces have been chosen on the geometric entities (such as some of the bases created by the D\+D\+R\+Core class below), and correspond then to the coefficients on these bases.
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{classHArDCore3D_1_1DDRCore}{D\+D\+R\+Core}}\+: class to construct bases of the local polynomial spaces, on all geometric entities, that are required for D\+DR schemes.
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{classHArDCore3D_1_1XGrad}{X\+Grad}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{classHArDCore3D_1_1XCurl}{X\+Curl}} and \mbox{\hyperlink{classHArDCore3D_1_1XDiv}{X\+Div}}\+: classes to compute the discrete operators, potentials, interpolators and $L^2$-\/inner products associated with each space in the D\+DR complex. Each of these classes uses some of the bases built in D\+D\+R\+Core, and is built on a corresponding D\+D\+R\+Space (which determines how the degrees of freedom, corresponding to the bases, are organised in the space).
\end{DoxyItemize}

Note that D\+D\+R\+Space could potentially be used for generic schemes (not just based on the discrete de Rham sequence), perhaps with a different ordering of the D\+O\+Fs.

{\bfseries{Important note}}\+: {\itshape a directory \char`\"{}\+D\+D\+R\+Core-\/orth\char`\"{} can be found in the repository. It corresponds to the D\+DR spaces using orthogonal complements to the images of the gradient and curl operators on polynomial spaces, as described in \href{https://doi.org/10.1142/S0218202520500372}{\texttt{ https\+://doi.\+org/10.\+1142/\+S0218202520500372}}. This directory is not commented here, and its code is not maintained any longer. The directory \char`\"{}\+D\+D\+R\+Core\char`\"{} is the one referred to in this documentation, is based on the Kozsul complements of the images of gradient and curl, as in \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04940,}{\texttt{ https\+://arxiv.\+org/abs/2101.\+04940,}} and is the one that is still maintained. D\+D\+R\+Core-\/orth is only provided for comparison purposes; the complements in this directory are much more expensive to create and manipulated, as explained in \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04946}{\texttt{ https\+://arxiv.\+org/abs/2101.\+04946}}. To compile a scheme using the orthogonal complements, simply modify the main C\+Make\+Lists.\+txt and change all \char`\"{}\+D\+D\+R\+Core\char`\"{} into \char`\"{}\+D\+D\+R\+Core-\/orth\char`\"{}.}

The directory {\ttfamily runs} contains B\+A\+SH scripts to run series of tests on families of meshes. The files {\ttfamily data.\+sh} describe the parameters of the test cases (polynomial degrees, boundary conditions, mesh families, etc.). The script produces results in the {\ttfamily output} directory, shows the convergence rate in the standard console output, and creates a pdf file {\ttfamily rate.\+pdf} describing the rates of convergence in various energy norms (you will need {\ttfamily pdflatex} to create this pdf file; commenting out the corresponding line is fine, the pdf will simply not be create).
